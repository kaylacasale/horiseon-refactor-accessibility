# Refactoring Existing Code to Maintain Original Formatting While Increasing Web 
## horiseon-refactor-accessibility

**Refactoring** means restructing existing code while not changing its original functionality.

**Accessibility** is important to ensure website is usable to maximum users.

## Installation
Link to Horiseon Webpage with Improved Accessibility: file:///Users/kaylacasale/Desktop/UCLA/homework/01-homework/horiseon-refactor-accessibility/index.html

Link to GitHub Repository containing "horison-refactor-accessibility" code: https://github.com/kaylacasale/horiseon-refactor-accessibility

## User Story
AS a developer
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standard
SO THAT the Horiseon website is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Mockup
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

### Focus Points
semantic elements, flexible and independent placement of style information, media-independent assets, heading ranks, and metadata
