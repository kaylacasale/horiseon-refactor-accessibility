# Refactoring Existing Code to Maintain Original Formatting While Increasing Web Accessibility 
## horiseon-refactor-accessibility

**Refactoring** means restructing existing code while not changing its original functionality.

**Accessibility** is important to ensure the website is usable to maximum users.

## Installation
**Link to Horiseon Webpage:** https://kaylacasale.github.io/horiseon-refactor-accessibility/Links to an external site.

**Link to GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/kaylacasale/horiseon-refactor-accessibility

## User Story
AS a **developer**

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standard

SO THAT the Horiseon website is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets **accessibility** standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find **semantic** HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a **logical structure independent** of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the icon and image elements

THEN I find accessible **alt attributes**

WHEN I view the **heading** attributes

THEN they fall in **sequential** order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive **title**

## Mockup
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

### Focus Points
semantic elements; logical structure and flexible and independent placement of style information, media-independent assets, sequential heading ranks, and metadata (e.g. alt attributes, title, etc.)
